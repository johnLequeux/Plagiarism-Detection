# Plagiarism-Detection

The aim of this project is to build a plagiarism detector that examines an answer text file and performs binary classification.

We will use two different kind of features to train the model:
  - containment features
  - Longest Common Subsequence
  
After training, the model will be used on a test set and will determine if the test file are either plagiarized or not.
